DevOps culture brings the cohesion of autonomous teams to fast
paced, high-demanding environments.
It has a set of processes that when applied correctly can:
1. Drastically reduce IT overhead
2. Remove manual tasks both of a mundane or complex nature
3. Enforce best security practices
4. Expedite product delivery
5. Improve communication and collaboration across teams
