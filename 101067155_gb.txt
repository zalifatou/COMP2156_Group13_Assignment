Counselling - For the stable guidance.
Athletics centre  - For the classes and space to let off steam.

Ususal Study Spots: As of winter2026
Casa Loma Caompus - main, tech software only here, quiet/chill
St.James - more people here, no tech supplies, buidling vibe is alittle sterile and enclosed though..
Limberlost - Dream scenic spot to learn in, but no tech - unfortunate really..
