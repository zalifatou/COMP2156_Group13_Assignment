College services beneficial to me, currently:
Inidigenous Initiatives - For the cultural workshops and other similar support/s.
Counselling - For the stable guidance.
Athletics centre  - For the classes and space to let off steam.

Ususal Study Spots to spot me: As of winter2026
Casa Loma Campus - main, tech software only here, quiet/chill
St.James - more people here, no tech supplies, buidling vibe is alittle sterile and enclosed though..
Limberlost - Dream scenic spot to learn in, but no tech - unfortunate really..
