Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

SDLC stands for Software Development Life Cycle.
It is a structured process used by software development teams to develop, design, test and deploy high 
quality software systems.

There are 7 phases of SDLC and they are as follows.
1. Planning: Project goals are defined, requirements are gathered and studies surrounding feasibility 
are conducted.
2. Analysis: Detailed system requirements are documented and analyzed.
3. Design: System building and design specifications are created.
4. Implementation: Developers write actual code based on the deisgn specifications.
5. Testing: The system is tested to locate and repair bugs and errors.
6. Deployment: Software is released to the users or to production.
7. Maintenance: Continuous updates, improvements and bug fixes are made after deployment.

Inportance of SDLC: 
-To ensure structured development process
-To reduce project risks
-To improve software quality
-To help manage time and cost effectively
-To encourage proper documentation

Some common SDLC models include:
Waterfall Model: A sequential and linear approach in which each phase must be completed before moving on.
Agile Model: An incremental and iterative approach that allows ongoing feedback and imporvement.
Spiral Model: A combination of iterative developments which includes risk analysis.

The most widely used model is Agile in modern software development due to its flexibility and fast delivery.

Common SDLC Deliverables include:
Requirements Document(SRS): Describes what the system must do.
Design Documents: Includes architechure diagrams and design specification.
Test Plan and Cases: Defines what will be testes and the expected results.
Deployment Plan: Steps to release the software into production.
Maintenance Logs: Records improvements, updates and bug fixes after the release.
