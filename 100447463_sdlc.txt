Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

SDLC stands for Software Development Life Cycle.
It is a structured process used by software development teams to develop, design, test and deploy high 
quality software systems.

There are 7 phases of SDLC and they are as follows.
1. Planning: Project goals are defined, requirements are gathered and studies surrounding feasibility 
are conducted.
2. Analysis: Detailed system requirements are documented and analyzed.
3. Design: System building and design specifications are created.
4. Implementation: Developers write actual code based on the deisgn specifications.
5. Testing: The system is tested to locate and repair bugs and errors.
6. Deployment: Software is released to the users or to production.
7. Maintenance: Continuous updates, improvements and bug fixes are made after deployment.

Inportance of SDLC: 
-To ensure structured development process
-To reduce project risks
-To improve software quality
-To help manage time and cost effectively
-To encourage proper documentation
